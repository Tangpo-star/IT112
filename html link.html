        <!-- First paragraph with line breaks for formatting -->
        The wind howled through the narrow alley, rustling papers and whispering forgotten secrets. <br>
        Shadows danced against the walls as a streetlamp flickered overhead, casting eerie glows <br>
        across the cobblestones. It was the kind of night that made the city feel alive — and dangerous.

        <!-- Second paragraph describing a peaceful scene -->
        In a small cottage nestled in the hills, an old woman stirred her tea and gazed out at the mist. <br>
        Her garden bloomed wildly despite the cold, a testament to years of care and patience. <br>
        She smiled softly, knowing some things didn’t need magic — only time and love.

        <!-- Third paragraph describing a lively market scene -->
        The market buzzed with energy, filled with the scent of spices and the clamor of voices. <br>
        Children weaved through the crowd chasing each other, and merchants shouted their deals. <br>
        Somewhere in the chaos, a deal was struck that would change a life forever.

    <p>
        <!-- Fourth paragraph describing a rainy indoor scene -->
        A raindrop slid down the window, tracing a lazy path as thunder echoed in the distance. <br>
        Inside, the fire crackled quietly, filling the room with warmth and calm. <br>
        Books lay open, half-read, as if the stories were waiting patiently to be finished.

    <p>
        <!-- Fifth paragraph about life under the sea -->
        Beneath the ocean waves, entire worlds existed out of sight. <br>
        Coral cities thrived with color and motion, teeming with life and ancient rhythms. <br>
        In that silence, the sea told stories older than any written word.
